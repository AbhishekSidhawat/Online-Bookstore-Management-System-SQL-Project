# Online-Bookstore-Management-System-SQL-Project
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based database system designed to manage an online bookstore. It covers essential components such as book inventory, customer records, and order transactions, along with both basic and advanced SQL queries for real-time data analysis.

## Project Overview

This SQL project simulates an **Online Bookstore Database Management System**. It includes database schema creation, data import from CSV files, and a wide variety of SQL queries for real-time analytics.

It is ideal for learning **database design**, **SQL querying**, and performing **data analysis** using real-world bookstore data.

## Features

### Database Structure
- `Books` – Contains details about books (title, author, genre, price, stock, etc.)
- `Customers` – Stores customer info (name, email, city, country, etc.)
- `Orders` – Tracks orders placed (date, quantity, total amount, foreign keys)

### Data Import
Data is loaded from local CSV files into each table

### SQL Queries
Includes both **basic** and **advanced** SQL queries:

#### Basic Queries:
- Books by genre
- Customers from specific countries
- Orders within a date range
- Stock & revenue summaries

#### Advanced Analytics:
- Most/least ordered books
- Top spending customers
- Sales grouped by genre and author
- Remaining stock after sales
- Average book prices by genre

## Sample Use Cases
- Calculate total revenue generated
- Find books with low stock
- See how many books sold by each author
- Track customer spending & order frequency
- Analyze customer locations with high spending
